My approach to this homework assignment is as follows:
1) Data Extraction and Modification:
     For this, I have explained in detail what my thinking was for each step of the function, but generally the idea was using dict.get() to find values stored in the given dictionaries.
   To run this python file, the command line would be:
   'python extract_parameter.py'
   
3) Chemical Solution Calculator:
   I can parse the strings given in the list solutions_needed to find the concentration of the chemical, and use the name of the chemical as they key in molecular_weights dict to find the molecular weight. I can then calculate the weight of the chemical and add edit the original list to display that as long as the chemical is in both the original list and the molecular_weights dictionary.
  This can be called by using the following command line:
  'python calculate_solution_weights.py'
